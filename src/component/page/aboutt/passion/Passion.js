                    Nanoblocks are similar in design to a Lego brick but
                    smaller, with the smallest brick being 4 mm × 4 mm 
                    × 5 mm. The bricks are 1⁄8 the size of Kawada's 
                    Diablock line of bricks. The underside of the 
                    bricks are different from Lego bricks because they 
                    use a dividing flange, known as the double-ridged 
                    backing system, instead of the tube system that Lego 
                    employs. The bricks are made using ABS plastic and 
                    there are eleven different types, the biggest being an 
                    8×2 brick and the smallest a single stud brick. 
                    Nanoblock sets typically include spare pieces.

                    Nanoblock was first introduced into the Japanese market 
                    in 2008 by Kawada. Nanoblock is distributed overseas 
                    by local companies, including Schylling in 
                    the United States and Mark's Europe in France and 
                    Benelux. In 2012, imports of Nanoblock reached 31 countries.

                    In 2010, Nanoblock won an Outstanding Performance Award in 
                    the High Target category at the Japan Toy Awards for the deluxe 
                    edition set based on Neuschwanstein Castle. The following year, 
                    Nanoblock won the Grand Prize in the High Target category at the 
                    2011 Japan Toy Awards for their model of the Tokyo Skytree. In 
                    2012, Nanoblock won the Brand License Award at the 2012 Licensing 
                    of the Year Awards.
